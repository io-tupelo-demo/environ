= Weavejester/Environ Library Demo

== Overview

This Clojure demo project shows how to configure and use the 
https://github.com/weavejester/environ[weavejester/environ]
library.

== Running in "test" mode

To use this project, we assume you have already installed Java, Clojure, and Leiningen, installed.

=== Verify you have Java, Clojure, and Leiningen set up correctly

Try the following commands, and make sure you get similar output:

```bash
> java --version
java 13 2019-09-17
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 13+33)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 13+33, mixed mode, sharing)

> lein --version
Leiningen 2.9.1 on Java 13 Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM
```

== Description of `project.clj` and `profiles.clj`

We don't want to check sensitive information like passords into SCM. Also, we will typically
have different credentials for different phases of a project
(e.g. database connections for dev, test, prod, etc).  For this demo, we place DB connection
strings for dev and test into `profiles.clj`.  This file is normally never checked into SCM, but we
have included a dummy version in this demo project for illustrative purposes.  It looks like this:

```clojure
{:profiles/dev  {:env {:database-url "jdbc:postgresql://localhost/dev"}}
 :profiles/test {:env {:database-url "jdbc:postgresql://localhost/test"}}}
```

== Running Unit Tests 

```pre
> lein clean ; lein test

lein test _bootstrap

-----------------------------------
   Clojure 1.10.3    Java 15.0.2
-----------------------------------

lein test tst.demo.core

Ran 2 tests containing 1 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.
( lein do clean, test; )  34.44s user 1.90s system 408% cpu 8.906 total
```

The file `test/clj/tst/demo/core.clj` verifies that the "test" DB URL is found.

== Running `-main` in "dev" mode

```pre
> lein clean ; lein run
```

The file `src/clj/tst/demo/core.clj` will print out the "dev" DB URL.

```pre
Running in demo.core/-main

(environ/env :database-url) => "jdbc:postgresql://localhost/dev"

( lein do clean, run; )  31.89s user 1.80s system 392% cpu 8.576 total
```

== Running `-main` in "prod" mode

Run the code using an environment variable to override `profiles.clj`:

```pre
> DATABASE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost/prod   lein run 

Warning: environ value jdbc:postgresql://localhost/dev for key :database-url has been overwritten with jdbc:postgresql://localhost/prod

Running in demo.core/-main
(environ/env :database-url) => "jdbc:postgresql://localhost/prod"

```

The file `src/clj/tst/demo/core.clj` will print out the "dev" DB URL.

```pre
Running in demo.core/-main

(environ/env :database-url) => "jdbc:postgresql://localhost/dev"

( lein do clean, run; )  31.89s user 1.80s system 392% cpu 8.576 total
```

It will also work if you run from a JAR file via `java -jar myproj.jar` instead of `lein run`


== Keeping Dependency Versions Up-To-Date

This project includes the `lein-ancient` plugin, which will tell you if any of your dependency
libraries are out of date. I have an alias:

```bash
alias laca="lein ancient check :all"
```

which will give you a list of version updates you should make, or just

```pre
all artifacts are up-to-date.
```

if you are already up-to-date on everything.
