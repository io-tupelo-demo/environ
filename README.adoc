= Environ Library Demo

A simple template for Clojure projects

== Overview

This Clojure project shows my favorite layout of for both source & test files
(sample Java source is included as well).  The project is also set-up to use the
https://github.com/cloojure/tupelo[Tupelo Clojure] library and the
https://github.com/jakemcc/lein-test-refresh[lein-test-refresh] plugin.

== How to User This Project

To use this project, we assume you have already installed Java, Clojure, and Leiningen, and `git`.

=== Clone the Project Using Git

Verify you have Git installed:

```bash
> git --version
git version 2.25.0
```

Use `git` to clone the project (via SSH) into a new project names `demo`:
```bash
> git clone  git@github.com:io-tupelo/clj-template.git  demo  # git ssh URL
```

or, clone via HTTPS (if you don't have SSH set up on your computer & GitHub):
```bash
> git clone  https://github.com/io-tupelo/clj-template.git  demo  # git https URL
```

Then `cd` (change directory) into the new project:

```bash
> cd demo
```

=== Verify you have Java, Clojure, and Leiningen set up correctly

Try the following commands, and make sure you get similar output:

```bash
> java --version
java 13 2019-09-17
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 13+33)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 13+33, mixed mode, sharing)

> lein --version
Leiningen 2.9.1 on Java 13 Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM
```

== Running Unit Tests - Plain

```pre
> lein clean
> lein test
```

== Keeping Dependency Versions Up-To-Date

This project includes the `lein-ancient` plugin, which will tell you if any of your dependency
libraries are out of date. I have an alias:

```bash
alias laca="lein ancient check :all"
```

which will give you a list of version updates you should make, or just

```pre
all artifacts are up-to-date.
```

if you are already up-to-date on everything.
